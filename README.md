# Hi3816_MEC

In the National Embedded Chip and System Design Competition held in 2022, we designed a remote conference system using DDPG to control the robotic arm and YOLOv2 to recognize human faces. In the remote conference scenario, this device can realize real‐time high‐precision tracking of the faces of participants. Our devices are developed using HiSilicon Hi3516 and Hi3861 chip‐based terminal platforms, using OpenHarmony as the underlying operating system.
